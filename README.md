# PYTHON
What is Python :
- Python is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
- Python is also an interpreted and high-level programming language.
- It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.
  
Features of Python :
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is interpreted and platform-independent, which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, TensorFlow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within Python.

# Python Variables
‚Üí Variables are containers that store information that can be manipulated and referenced later by the programmer within the code.

‚Üí In Python, the programmer does not need to declare the variable type explicitly; we just need to assign the value to the variable.

name = "Abhishek"   # type str

age = 20            # type int

passed = True       # type bool

‚Üí It is always advisable to keep variable names descriptive and to follow a set of conventions while creating variables:

- Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).

- Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character.

- Variables are case sensitive.

- Variable names cannot start with a number.

üï∏Ô∏è Scope of Variable:
The scope of the variable is the area within which the variable has been created. Based on this, a variable can either have a local scope or a global scope.

üï∏Ô∏è Local Variable:
A local variable is created within a function and can only be used inside that function. Such a variable has a local scope.

üï∏Ô∏è Global Variable:
A global variable is created in the main body of the code and can be used anywhere within the code. Such a variable has a global scope.
